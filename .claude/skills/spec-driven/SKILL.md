name: spec-driven
description: Project and feature planning with 4 adaptive phases - Specify, Design, Tasks, Execute. Auto-sizes depth by complexity. Creates atomic tasks with verification criteria, atomic git commits, requirement traceability, and persistent memory across sessions. Stack-agnostic. Use when (1) Starting new projects (initialize vision, goals, roadmap), (2) Working with existing codebases (map stack, architecture, conventions), (3) Planning features (requirements, design, task breakdown), (4) Implementing with verification and atomic commits, (5) Quick ad-hoc tasks (bug fixes, config changes), (6) Tracking decisions/blockers/deferred ideas across sessions, (7) Pausing/resuming work. Triggers on "initialize project", "map codebase", "specify feature", "discuss feature", "design", "tasks", "implement", "validate", "verify work", "UAT", "quick fix", "quick task", "pause work", "resume work". Do NOT use for architecture decomposition analysis (use architecture skills) or technical design docs (use create-technical-design-doc).

# Spec-Driven Development

Plan and implement projects with precision. Granular tasks. Clear dependencies. Right tools. Zero ceremony.

```
┌──────────┐   ┌──────────┐   ┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐
│ SPECIFY  │ → │  DESIGN  │ → │  TASKS  │ → │ EXECUTE │
└──────────┘   └──────────┘   └─────────┘   └─────────┘
   required      optional*      optional*     required

* Agent auto-skips when scope doesn't need it
```

## Auto-Sizing: The Core Principle

**The complexity determines the depth, not a fixed pipeline.** Before starting any feature, assess its scope and apply only what's needed:

| Scope       | What                     | Specify                                                 | Design                                          | Tasks                         | Execute                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Small**   | ≤3 files, one sentence   | **Quick mode** — skip pipeline entirely                 | -                                               | -                             | -                                                     |
| **Medium**  | Clear feature, <10 tasks | Spec (brief)                                            | Skip — design inline                            | Skip — tasks implicit         | Implement + verify                                    |
| **Large**   | Multi-component feature  | Full spec + requirement IDs                             | Architecture + components                       | Full breakdown + dependencies | Implement + verify per task                           |
| **Complex** | Ambiguity, new domain    | Full spec + [discuss gray areas](references/discuss.md) | [Research](references/design.md) + architecture | Breakdown + parallel plan     | Implement + [interactive UAT](references/validate.md) |

**Rules:**

- **Specify and Execute are always required** — you always need to know WHAT and DO it
- **Design is skipped** when the change is straightforward (no architectural decisions, no new patterns)
- **Tasks is skipped** when there are ≤3 obvious steps (they become implicit in Execute)
- **Discuss is triggered within Specify** only when the agent detects ambiguous gray areas that need user input
- **Interactive UAT is triggered within Execute** only for user-facing features with complex behavior
- **Quick mode** is the express lane — for bug fixes, config changes, and small tweaks

**Safety valve:** Even when Tasks is skipped, Execute ALWAYS starts by listing atomic steps inline (see [implement.md](references/implement.md)). If that listing reveals >5 steps or complex dependencies, STOP and create a formal `tasks.md` — the Tasks phase was wrongly skipped.

## Adaptação local — como esta skill se encaixa neste projeto

Estas adaptações valem sobre o texto original em caso de conflito:

- **`specs/` é visível**, não `.specs/`. Um projeto = um `specs/` + um `docs/`.
- **São três lugares, não dois.** `specs/` é o plano do produto, `docs/` é o
  sistema como ele é, e a **execução mora fora do repositório**: `STATE.md`,
  `TASKS.md` e `ACTION-PLAN.md` ficam um nível acima, na pasta de controle, e é
  de lá que a skill os lê e escreve. Onde o texto original fala em `ROADMAP.md`,
  leia `TASKS.md`. **Não** crie cópias deles dentro do repo
  — duas cópias do andamento é como o andamento passa a estar errado nas duas.
  Ver `.claude/rules/docs-and-specs.md`.
- **Os requisitos com ID estão em `specs/project/REQUIREMENTS.md`**, por área
  (`REQ-MON-001`, `REQ-CON-006`). O `spec.md` de cada feature declara quais
  cobre. Não invente requisito que não esteja lá: acrescente ao arquivo primeiro.
- **Caminho em inglês, prosa em português.** Slug de feature
  (`0001-financial-domain-core`), nome de ADR e de doc em inglês; o conteúdo, não.
- **Commits seguem `.claude/rules/git-flow.md`** — Conventional Commits, subject
  em inglês, e **nunca** `Co-Authored-By` ou qualquer atribuição de IA. O hook
  `commit-msg` rejeita; não tente contornar com `--no-verify`.
- **O gate de cada task é `make check`** — `gofmt`, `go vet`, `domain-check`,
  `go test` e `go test -race`. Não invente outro comando.
- **Feature = `specs/features/NNNN-slug/`**, numeração sequencial de 4 dígitos,
  contínua no projeto inteiro.
- Não existe `specs/codebase/` aqui: o projeto é novo, não há brownfield a mapear.
- Ao registrar uma decisão estrutural, além do `STATE.md` abra um ADR em
  `docs/adr/` — `STATE.md` é memória de trabalho e é reescrito; ADR é permanente.

## Workflow

**New project:**

1. Initialize project → PROJECT.md + ../TASKS.md
2. For each feature → Specify → (Design) → (Tasks) → Execute (depth auto-sized)

**Existing codebase:**

1. Map codebase → 7 brownfield docs
2. Initialize project → PROJECT.md + ../TASKS.md
3. For each feature → same adaptive workflow

**Quick mode:** Describe → Implement → Verify → Commit (for ≤3 files, one-sentence scope)

## Context Loading Strategy

**Base load (~15k tokens):**

- PROJECT.md (if exists)
- ../TASKS.md (when planning/working on features)
- ../STATE.md (persistent memory)

**On-demand load:**

- Codebase docs (when working in existing project)
- CONCERNS.md (when planning features that touch flagged areas, estimating risk, or modifying fragile components)
- TESTING.md (when creating tasks or executing — drives test type assignment and gate checks)
- spec.md (when working on specific feature)
- context.md (when designing or implementing from user decisions)
- design.md (when implementing from design)
- tasks.md (when executing tasks)

**Never load simultaneously:**

- Multiple feature specs
- Multiple architecture docs
- Archived documents

**Target:** <40k tokens total context
**Reserve:** 160k+ tokens for work, reasoning, outputs
**Monitoring:** Display status when >40k (see [context-limits.md](references/context-limits.md))

## Sub-Agent Delegation

Use sub-agents (the Task tool or equivalent) to keep the main context window lean and enable
parallel execution. The orchestrating agent plans and coordinates; sub-agents do the heavy lifting.

**When to delegate to a sub-agent:**

| Activity | Delegate? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Research (design phase, brownfield mapping) | Yes | Research output is large; only the summary matters to the main context |
| Implementing a task | Yes | File reads, edits, test output consume context; only the result matters |
| Parallel `[P]` tasks | Yes (one per task) | The only way to actually run tasks in parallel |
| Sequential tasks with no `[P]` | Yes | Keeps implementation artifacts out of the main context |
| Planning, task creation, validation reports | No | These require the full accumulated context to be coherent |
| Quick mode tasks | No | Too small to justify the overhead |

**Context each sub-agent receives:**

The orchestrating agent MUST provide each sub-agent with:
- The specific task definition from tasks.md (What, Where, Depends on, Reuses, Done when, Tests, Gate)
- Relevant coding principles and conventions (coding-principles.md, CONVENTIONS.md)
- TESTING.md, if it exists (for gate check commands and test patterns)
- Any spec/design context the task references

The sub-agent does NOT receive: other tasks' definitions, accumulated chat history, validation reports
from other tasks, or ../STATE.md (unless the task explicitly references a decision/blocker).

**What sub-agents return:**

Each sub-agent reports back:
- Status: Complete | Blocked | Partial
- Files changed: [list]
- Gate check result: [pass/fail + test counts]
- SPEC_DEVIATION markers (if any)
- Issues encountered (if any)

The orchestrating agent uses this to update tasks.md status, traceability, and decide next steps.

## Skill Integrations

This skill coexists with other skills. Before specific tasks, check if complementary skills are installed and prefer them when available.

### Diagrams → mermaid-studio

Whenever the workflow requires creating or updating a diagram (architecture overviews, data flows, component diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc.), **always** check if the `mermaid-studio` skill is installed in the user's environment before proceeding. If it is installed, delegate all diagram creation and rendering to it. If it is not installed, proceed with inline mermaid code blocks as usual and recommend the user install `mermaid-studio` for richer diagram capabilities (rendering to SVG/PNG, validation, theming, etc.). Display this recommendation at most once per session.

### Code Exploration → codenavi

Whenever the workflow requires exploring or discovering things in an existing repository (brownfield mapping, code reuse analysis, pattern identification, dependency tracing, etc.), **always** check if the `codenavi` skill is installed in the user's environment before proceeding. If it is installed, delegate code exploration and navigation tasks to it. If it is not installed, fall back to the built-in code analysis tools (see [code-analysis.md](references/code-analysis.md)) and recommend the user install `codenavi` for more effective codebase exploration. Display this recommendation at most once per session.

## Knowledge Verification Chain

When researching, designing, or making any technical decision, follow this chain in strict order. Never skip steps.

```
Step 1: Codebase → check existing code, conventions, and patterns already in use
Step 2: Project docs → README, docs/, specs/project/REQUIREMENTS.md, doc.go de cada pacote
Step 3: Context7 MCP → resolve library ID, then query for current API/patterns
Step 4: Web search → official docs, reputable sources, community patterns
Step 5: Flag as uncertain → "I'm not certain about X — here's my reasoning, but verify"
```

**Rules:**

- Never skip to Step 5 if Steps 1-4 are available
- Step 5 is ALWAYS flagged as uncertain — never presented as fact
- **NEVER assume or fabricate.** If you cannot find an answer, say "I don't know" or "I couldn't find documentation for this". Inventing APIs, patterns, or behaviors causes cascading failures across design → tasks → implementation. Uncertainty is always preferable to fabrication.

## Output Behavior

**Model guidance:** After completing lightweight tasks (validation, state updates, session handoff), naturally mention once that such tasks work well with faster/cheaper models. Track in ../STATE.md under `Preferences` to avoid repeating. For heavy tasks (brownfield mapping, complex design), briefly note the reasoning requirements before starting.

Be conversational, not robotic. Don't interrupt workflow—add as a natural closing note. Skip if user seems experienced or has already acknowledged the tip.

## Code Analysis

Use available tools with graceful degradation. See [code-analysis.md](references/code-analysis.md).
